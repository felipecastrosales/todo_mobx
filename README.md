<p align="center">
   Knowing something new usually brings us many challenges. And so, they come, and our mission is to solve problems, not just as programmers. And with it, the new one I met was Mob-X.<br>
   At first it was a challenge, because I had only done half of the app, and it came as sensational opportunity that I couldn't pass up. Anyway, understanding Mob-X and how it works in simple and practical, using your awesome Core Concept.<br>
   This was undoubtedly the State Manager that I enj using most so far, but there are still a few more to discover, so let's continue with this learning, which be continous!
